        The designation as a European Cultural Capital for 2007, owed greatly to
        the excellent collaboration with Luxembourg, but also to what many
        regard as a miraculous social rebirth taking place in the city during
        the last years. The Cultural Capital status was expected to bring about
        an abrupt increase in quantity and quality of cultural events in 2007.
