        Sibiu ([si'biw], German: Hermannstadt Hungarian: Nagyszeben) is a city
        in Transylvania, a historical region of Romania. Located some 275 km
        (171 mi) north-west of Bucharest, the city straddles the Cibin River,
        a tributary of the river Olt. Now the capital of the Sibiu County,
        between 1692 and 1791 and 1849-65 Sibiu was also the capital of the
        Principality of Transylvania. Nicknamed The City with Eyes, the city
        is a well-known tourist destination for both domestic and foreign
        visitors. Known for its culture, history, gastronomy and its diverse
        architecture, which includes its much iconic houses with eyes that
        gave Sibiu its nickname, the city has been getting much attention
        since the beginning of the 21st century. In 2004, its historical
        center has begun the process of becoming a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
        Sibiu was designated the European Capital of Culture in 2007. One year
        later, it was ranked "Europe's 8th-most idyllic place to live" by
        Forbes. In 2019, Sibiu was named the European Region of Gastronomy,
        while in 2020 it was designated "Europe's sixth best tourist
        destination". Sibiu will host the European Wandering Capital event in
        2021, the most important tourist wandering event in Europe. A European
        Union summit was hosted by the city in 2019. Sibiu is also known for
        its Christmas market. Personalities include Conrad Haas and Hermann
        Oberth, who were pioneers of rocketry. The company Elrond, which
        created the eGold cryptocurrency (among the biggest in the world), was
        founded by people from Sibiu. As of 2011, the city has a population of
        147,245, while a 2019 estimate puts it at 169,056. The proposed Sibiu
        metropolitan area has a population of 267,170. The city also
        administers the village of Paltinis, a ski resort located 35
        kilometres to the south. Historically, Sibiu has been one of the most
        important centres of the Transylvanian Saxons. It is called
        Haermeschtat in their dialect.
