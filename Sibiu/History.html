        Sibiu was initially a Daco-Roman city called Cedonia. The town was
        refounded by Saxon (German) settlers brought there by king Géza II of
        Hungary. They came from territories of the Holy Roman Empire and Kingdom
        of France (nowadays parts of Germany, France and the Benelux countries)
        and arrived at around 1147. The first references to the area were
        Cibinium and Cipin from 1191 when Pope Celestine III confirmed the
        existence of the free prepositure of the Saxons in Transylvania, having
        its headquarters in Sibiu. The city also used the names Prepositus
        Cibiniensis (1192-1196) and Prepositus Scibiniensis (1211). In 1223, it
        was renamed to Villa Hermanni, either in honor of archbishop Hermann II
        of Cologne or after a man who is believed to have founded the city,
        Hermann of Nuremberg. The actual German name of Hermannstadt ("Hermann's
        city") dates from 1366, while an earlier form, Hermannsdorf ("Hermann's
        village") was recorded in 1321. <br /><br />
        In the 14th century, it was already an important trade centre. In 1376,
        the craftsmen were divided in 19 guilds. Sibiu became the most important
        ethnic German city among the seven cities that gave Transylvania its
        German name Siebenbürgen (literally seven citadels). It was home to the
        Universitas Saxorum (Community of the Saxons), a network of pedagogues,
        ministers, intellectuals, city officials, and councilmen of the German
        community forging an ordered legal corpus and political system in
        Transylvania since the 1400s. In 1699, after the Ottomans withdrew to
        their base of power in Hungary and Transylvania, the town became capital
        of Principality of Transylvania (since 1570 the principality was mostly
        under suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire, however often had a dual
        vassalage). During the 18th and 19th centuries, the city became the
        second- and later the first-most important centre of Transylvanian
        Romanian ethnics. The first Romanian-owned bank had its headquarters
        here (The Albina Bank), as did the ASTRA (Transylvanian Association for
        Romanian Literature and Romanian's People Culture). After the Romanian
        Orthodox Church was granted status in the Austrian Empire from the 1860s
        onwards, Sibiu became the Metropolitan seat, and the city is still
        regarded as the third-most important centre of the Romanian Orthodox
        Church. Between the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and 1867 (the year of
        the Ausgleich), Sibiu was the meeting-place of the Transylvanian Diet,
        which had taken its most representative form after the Empire agreed to
        extend voting rights in the region.
        <br /><br />
        After World War I, when Austria-Hungary was dissolved, Sibiu became part
        of Romania; the majority of its population was still ethnic German
        (until 1941) and counted a large Romanian community, as well as a
        smaller Hungarian one. Starting from the 1950s and until after 1990,
        most of the city's ethnic Germans emigrated to Germany and Austria.
        Among the roughly 2,000 who have remained is Klaus Iohannis, the current
        President of Romania.
